# Retail-Analysis
In Retail Data Analysis project I cleaned and explored retail data to understand customers, sales trends, and product performance. The analysis includes RFM scoring, customer insights, and visualizations to identify key patterns and business opportunities.

## What I Did
- Cleaned the data (duplicates, missing values, date formats)
- Analyzed customer details (age, gender, income, segments)
- Studied sales trends (monthly sales, product performance)
- Performed RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Created different charts for visualization
